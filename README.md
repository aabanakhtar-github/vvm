# vvm
Vortex virtual machine - A basic stack-based vm for the vortex interpreter. It supports all the fundamental operations any stack machine should have, including: 
- PUSH
- POP
- ADD
- SUBTRACT
- and more...

It also has support for local variables and scope management, both of which are used for the implementation of if/while statements in the vortex language.
